# urulink Chat Application

## Overview

This is a **backend chat application** designed for private or local chat environments. Built using **Golang** and the **Fiber** framework, this application leverages modern technologies to facilitate real-time communication and efficient data management.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizes **WebSocket** for instant messaging capabilities.
- **User Connection Management**: Employs **Redis** for storing and managing user connections.
- **Message Broker**: Integrates **RabbitMQ** for efficient message handling and queuing.
- **Object Storage**: Uses **MinIO** for object storage, ensuring that all media and files are securely managed.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Built using a microservice architecture to promote modularity and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Fiber**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Golang, used to create the server.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **Redis**: A powerful in-memory data store used for managing user sessions and connections.
- **RabbitMQ**: A robust message broker that enables reliable communication between microservices.
- **MinIO**: A high-performance object storage solution compatible with Amazon S3 APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization of users in the application.

## Getting Started

To set up the chat application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.16 or higher)
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Install [Fiber](https://docs.gofiber.io)
- Install [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
- Install [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
- Install [MinIO](https://min.io/download)

### Installation

- Clone all microservices and use the Dockerfile inside each one to build the service.
- Make sure to fill all required environment variables in `.env` files before building the Docker image.


## How to Use It

Once all microservices are up and running, follow these steps to start using the chat application:

### 1. Register an Account
First, you need to register an account using the Auth service:
- Endpoint: ```POST http://<your-auth-service-ip>:8081/register```
- Payload: Include necessary registration details (e.g., username, password).

This will create a new user account for you in the system.

### 2. Log In
Once your account is created, log in to obtain an access token for authentication:
- Endpoint: ```POST http://<your-auth-service-ip>:8081/login```
- Payload: Provide your registered username and password.
- Response: After a successful login, youâ€™ll receive an accessToken in the response.

This accessToken is required to establish an authenticated WebSocket connection.

### 3. Connect to WebSocket
To connect to WebSocket for real-time messaging:

- Add the accessToken: Include the accessToken you received from the Auth service in the header of your WebSocket connection request.
- WebSocket Endpoint: ```ws://<your-message-service-ip>:8083?receiver_id=<target-client-id>```
- Replace ```<target-client-id>``` with the ID of the client you want to communicate with.

This will establish a WebSocket connection, enabling real-time messaging between you and the specified client
